# Kavya Arts Website (Working Package)

This package is ready to run and includes:
- Vintage-themed page (index.html, styles.css, script.js)
- Assets (parchment texture, ornament)
- Gallery manifest with 11 artworks (data/images.json)
- Placeholder image files using your exact filenames (overwrite with your originals)
- WhatsApp contact button that opens chat to 9381850041 without displaying the number on the site

## Finalize
1. Overwrite placeholders in `images/` with your actual images (keep the same filenames).
2. Serve locally:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8080
   ```
   then open `http://localhost:8080/`.
3. Deploy by uploading the entire folder to your hosting.
